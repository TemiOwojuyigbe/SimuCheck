# SimuCheck - Device Diagnostics Simulator

SimuCheck is a web-based diagnostic simulation tool that mimics how automated test equipment (ATE) verifies the readiness of ruggedized RF (radio frequency) or IR (infrared) devices used in mission-critical systems — similar to those tested by companies like Textron Systems.

Built with Python, Flask, and Bootstrap, this project allows users to simulate powering on a device, running diagnostics, and reviewing test history through a clean, interactive interface.

##  Features

- Simulates the power-up and diagnostic behavior of an RF device
- Logs pass/fail results with signal strength to a local log file
- Displays historical test logs in a timeline-style view
- One-click "Run New Test" button for instant test execution
- Clean and responsive UI built with Bootstrap
- Option to clear all logs with a single click

## Why This Project?

Textron Systems develops test equipment for aircraft survivability systems. I created this project to simulate a simplified version of that environment — focusing on device readiness testing, diagnostic logic, and real-time logging.
